# Mini Research: Azure Certificate Study

I already publicly share resources i like for bookmarking purposes, like notes to myself. But actually those shares are just part of a mini-research, i have questions in my mind and just try to find answers. I want to present that mini-researches by providing context. 

I have been experiencing Azure about over a year and a half now. I architected and used it in two products already and third is on its way. The first one was born on Azure, others are migrations from Predix cloud and on-prem chronolically speaking. All three are in different tech stacks. First one is MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and NodeJS), the second one is Javascript, Polymer, Postgres and third one is Microsoft's tech stack (C++, C#, Powershell scripts). My short-term goal is to take [two Azure architect exams (300 and 301)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/azure-solutions-architect.aspx) and close my tech gap during this preparation journey.

The very first step is covering the basics entirely, setting up the foundation so well that we do not get shaky when we dive deep into details. [Microsoft Learn, Azure Fundamentals path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals/) does an excellent job for this purpose. This is a 9-hour path in total and definitely worth the time. There are some external articles referenced in courses, below the ones i recommend:

Once Azure fundamentals are covered, next step might be [Managing Resources in Azure path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/manage-resources-in-azure/) to feel comfortable using Azure CLI and Powershell. This path already some overlap with previous path, so will take less time it estimates, i believe it will take a little more than 2 hours.

Since i am already an architect and have a passion designing systems, i especially liked [Architect great solutions in Azure path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/architect-great-solutions-in-azure/). 
.....

Security is important an there is a [learning path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/secure-your-cloud-data/) with duration about 6 hours..

I learned Azure with two external motivations: get a certificate, do my job well.. Of course i have the inner motivation too. But since i also involved in something because of my job, there might be some irrelevant things here.. I tried to eliminate them, but still i find it useful to state that..
